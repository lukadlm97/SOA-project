# Project description
A project created for the subject of Service-oriented architecture at a Master's study level, which aims to demonstrate the powerful capabilities of gRPC in .NET 5. This project would be a web application that utilizes gRPC to communicate between the client and the server. The application would be built using C# and .NET 5, utilizing the latest features of the framework to showcase the power of gRPC in building high-performance and efficient service-oriented architectures.

The application would be designed to demonstrate the use of gRPC in various scenarios, such as communication between microservices, real-time data streaming, and bi-directional communication. The application would also include features like load balancing, service discovery, and circuit breaker patterns to demonstrate how gRPC can be used in a production environment.

The project would also include a detailed explanation of the various components of gRPC and how they are used in the application, as well as a comparison of gRPC with other technologies like REST and SOAP.

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of gRPC and its use in service-oriented architectures, and to demonstrate how it can be used to build high-performance and efficient systems in .NET 5.
